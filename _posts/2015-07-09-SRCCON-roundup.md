We were lucky to be able to show off Flatsheet at this year's SRCCON through a self-guided workshop where participants were able to learn about both Dat and Flatsheet and how they might be used together.

You can try out that workshop from home, too! Go here: [http://maxogden.github.io/get-dat](http://maxogden.github.io/get-dat)

We made a special edition of Flatsheet, hand-crafted just for the workshop. It's a simpler application that runs from the command-line. Check it out here: [https://github.com/sethvincent/data-editor](https://github.com/sethvincent/data-editor)
