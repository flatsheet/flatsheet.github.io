We're nearing the end of our grant period for the Knight Prototype Fund. Here's a roundup of what we've done so far and what we'll be working on over the next month.

Our biggest recent announcement is the early launch of [editdata.org](http://editdata.org), a free tool that lets you edit tabular data and save it to GitHub. It's built using the same JavaScript modules we've written for flatsheet, and serves as a sneak preview of flatsheet.

## Our initial goals for the Knight Prototype Fund grant:
- Conduct user testing
- Improve editor based on user testing
- Improve JSON API
- Write documentation

## What we accomplished
- Multiple user testing sessions
- Substantial improvements to the flatsheet editor
- Roughly a dozen new JavaScript/Node.js modules and contributions to many more
- A much better sense of what our potential users need

## What we learned
- Without stronger visual cues to suggest otherwise, people will assume flatsheet is meant for spreadsheets and acts like spreadsheet software
- How users collaborate with other users on their datasets
  - People need GitHub style forking and merging more than they need realtime editing
  - It's very important that the accounts/permissions system is flexible and easy to use

## Some of the code we've produced:
- [editdata.org](http://editdata.org) – a simple, free tool for editing tabular data & storing it on GitHub.
- [improved editor](http://github.com/sethvincent/editor-prototype) based on user testing
- [datwrapper](http://github.com/flatsheet/datwrapper) – a wrapper around dat for managing multiple dat instances via JS and JSON API
- [data-schema](http://github.com/sethvincent/data-schema) – a module for setting, validating column types
- [data-cards](http://github.com/sethvincent/data-cards) – an approach to interacting with tabular data that isn't a table/spreadsheet
- [data-grid](http://github.com/sethvincent/data-grid) – a grid editor/viewer for tabular data
- [data-editor](http://github.com/sethvincent/data-editor) – a command-line tool for editing a csv file
- [data-ui](http://github.com/sethvincent/data-ui) – a collection of modules and resources for creating UIs for managing data
- [township](http://github.com/civicmakerlab/township) – an accounts system that is its own open-source project and internally uses:
  - [accounts-api](http://github.com/lukeswart/accounts-api) – a system for managing accounts via JS and JSON API
  - [accountdown-model](http://github.com/sethvincent/accountdown-model) – a wrapper around [accountdown](http://github.com/substack/accountdown) that adds additional functionality
  - a flexible permissions system inspired by GitHub's

## What we're working on now:
- Bundling the above independent projects into the flatsheet application
- Launching flatsheet.io as a hosted service
- Writing detailed documentation
- Building additional example projects

## What we plan to work on next:
- GitHub-style fork & pull requests, with small differences that better fit the use case of "data as editorial content" and that are based upon dat's slightly different functionality
- Building additional compatible modules that extend flatsheet's functionality and adapt it for different use cases
- Supporting the community environment monitoring project [heyduwamish.org](http://heyduwamish.org) by improving their moderation and admin functionality through the same JavaScript modules that are used in flatsheet.

## Our ongoing goals:
- Build a user interface that allows GitHub-like fork/merge functionality
- Build an open-source community around dat & flatsheet 
  - Through documentation, example projects, & related js libraries
- Continue exploring flatsheet's potential use as an open data portal
- Continue building [township](http://github.com/civicmakerlab/township), the accounts system we've been working on based on our experience with flatsheet.
