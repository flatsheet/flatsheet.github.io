Today the Knight Foundation [announced the latest cohort of grantees in the Knight Prototype Fund](http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2015/2/10/knight-prototype-fund-supports-10-new-data-storytelling-projects/), and Flatsheet is [one of the projects](http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201450224/)!

With this grant I'll be focused on improving the experience of inputting, validating, and revising data. It'll be a chance to experiment with editing loosely-structured tabular data using approaches beyond a simple spreadsheet-style grid editor -- an opportunity to ask "how might we make data input simple and pleasant instead of mind-numbingly boring."

## Human-centered design

The grant kicked off with a weekend-long human-centered design workshop at the [LUMA Institute](http://www.luma-institute.com/), where I learned more about sticky notes than I ever expected to learn. There were a lot of sticky notes. And I joke about the sticky notes, but it was a really great workshop. 

I used the weekend as a chance to think about Flatsheet as if it were a new project. If I were to start from scratch, what assumptions would I test, who would I interview and do user-testing with, and what approach would I take with Flatsheet's user interface?

My goal for the next few months is to take what I learned from that workshop and attempt to answer the above questions, iterating on user interface improvements and new features.

## Next steps

Here's a rough outline of what's in store for Flatsheet development over the next few months:

### User testing
- usability & features of editor
- using Flatsheet with other tools
- building a simple app with Flatsheet data
- using presentation templates

### Editor improvements
- alternate editing modes
- UI components for input & validation of specific data types
- UI improvements based on feedback from user testing

### Improve JSON API
- Provide GeoJSON when data includes lat/long or standard GeoJSON features
- Provide CSV endpoint

### Presentation templates
- Map, table, list views of data

### Integration with related tools
- sheetsee.js
- tarbell
- dat

### Documentation
 - How to use the UI
 - API documentation â€“ both json & javascript APIs
 - Guides for building projects with Flatsheet
