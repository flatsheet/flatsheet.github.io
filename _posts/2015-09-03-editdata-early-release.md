We released a special version of Flatsheet targeted specifically at editing CSV & JSON files on GitHub. [Try it out!](http://editdata.org)

If you've ever had tabular data in a GitHub repository and thought:

"Hey, it would be nice to edit that data somehow without needing to edit the file directly or copy/pasting between the file and a spreadsheet all the time."

Then that would be a really nerdy, specific thought to have & we should probably be friends. It's also the exact need that editdata.org is designed to address.

It's a very early release. Things might break. If things do break, please let us know by replying to this email, or by opening an issue on the editdata.org github repository.

Let us know if editdata.org is useful to you, if there are bugs you notice or features you'd appreciate, or even if you'd like to contribute to the project!
